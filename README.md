                                                ***THE RULE OF THE GAME***
                                                    
The rock paper scissors is simple **two players game** where you and your oponent (the computer) chose one of three options: 'Rock' , 'Paper' or 'Scissors'. 

- **Rock beats scissors** <sub>(the scissores get broken by the rock)</sub>
- **Paper beats rock** <sub>(the paper covers the rock)</sub>
- **Scissors beats paper** <sub>(the paper get cut by the scissors)</sub>

The **winner** is the player whose choice beats the choice of his oponent. If both players choose the same option (e.g. 'rock'), the game outcome is '**draw**'.
